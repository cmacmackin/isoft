Title: Plotting Internal Layers

ISOFT has the ability to simulate the advection of a Lagrangian tracer
distributed in the z-direction. The main use for this is to track the
evolution of isochrones, which correspond to internal radar reflectors
observed in ice sheets and shelves. ISOFT achieves this by expressing
the tracer as a Taylor expansion in _z_ and then calculating changes
to the Taylor coefficients. It is only the coefficients which are
stored.

Visualising this tracer data requires converting it to a 2-D form in
_x_ and _z_. For this purpose, the plotting/[[layers.py]] module
provides a routine called `compute_layers`. This has the call
signature
```python
x, z, k = compute_layers(shelf, vertical_resolution=300)
```
where `x` and `z` are 2-D arrays containing the coordinates in _x_ and
_z_ respectively, `k` is a 2-D array containing the values of the
tracer. These are calculated from `shelf`, which is either a `Glacier`
or a `ShelfPlumeCryosphere` object (see
[Reader Objects](./readers.html)). The number of intervals in _z_ on
which to calculate `k` is set by the argument `vertical_ resolution`.

With this output, a contour plot can be produced, showing the presence
of internal layers within the ice shelf. This is demonstrated in the
script below, along with example output.

```python
from plotting.readers import ShelfPlumeCryosphere
from plotting.layers import compute_layers

import numpy as np
import numpy.ma as ma
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

cryo = ShelfPlumeCryosphere('isoft-0000.h5')

nz = 1200
conts = 16

x, z, k = compute_layers(cryo, nz)

plt.plot(cryo.grid, cryo.s, 'k')
plt.plot(cryo.grid, cryo.b, 'k')
plt.contour(x, z, k, conts, linewidths=0.5, colors='k')
plt.contourf(x, z, k, conts, cmap='PuBu')
plt.xlabel('$x$')
plt.ylabel('$z$')
plt.colorbar(orientation='horizontal', label=r'$k$')
plt.show()
```
