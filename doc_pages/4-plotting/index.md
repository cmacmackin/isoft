Title: Plotting ISOFT Output
Author: Chris MacMackin
Date: November 2018 

ISOFT provides a small library of plotting scripts with which to
analyse the HDF5 files which it outputs. This is divided into two parts:

1. A set of routines which read and process the HDF5 data.
2. A selection of executable scripts which actually produce plots.

The scripts provide some basic functionality with which to visualise
the output of ISOFT. However, you will likely want to write some
scripts of your own to provide more complex, bespoke analysis.
