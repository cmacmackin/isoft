Title: Using ISOFT
Author: Chris MacMackin
Date: November 2018 

ISOFT isn't so much a program or library in the traditional sense, as
a suite of tools for simulating the evolution of an ice shelf. It
provides:

- a library of derived types to run these simulations
- a sample program making use of this library
- a compile script to link your programs with the necessary libraries
- a set of python scripts for plotting the output of simulations

This section will walk you through compiling the library and programs
which use it. The plotting scripts are discussed in the section
[Plotting ISOFT Output](../4-plotting/index.html).
