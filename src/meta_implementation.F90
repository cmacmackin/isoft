  ! Implements functions specifying the version of ISOFT, time of
  ! compilation, etc. This is done in a submodule because it should be
  ! recompiled with every build (so that compilation time is accurate)
  ! but without a submodule that would require every module using it
  ! to be recompiled as well.
